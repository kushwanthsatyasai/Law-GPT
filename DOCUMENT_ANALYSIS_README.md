   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. For EasyOCR, you may need additional system dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
   
   # macOS
   brew install libgl
   ```

3. Restart the backend service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Contract Analysis**
Upload a service agreement and get analysis of:
- Payment terms and schedules
- Termination conditions
- Liability limitations
- Confidentiality requirements

### 2. **Employment Agreement Review**
Analyze employment contracts for:
- At-will employment clauses
- Non-compete restrictions
- Intellectual property assignments

- **Medium documents** (5-20 pages): 15-45 seconds
- **Large documents** (> 20 pages): 45+ seconds

### Optimization Tips
1. Use "Quick" analysis for initial screening
2. Focus on specific areas for targeted analysis
3. Process documents during off-peak hours
4. Consider document size when uploading

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- **OCR Failures**: Automatic fallback to alternative methods
- **AI Analysis Errors**: Graceful degradation with manual review prompts
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms and user notifications
- **Invalid Documents**: Clear error messages and guidance

## Security & Privacy

- All document processing happens server-side
- Documents are stored securely in user-specific directories
- AI analysis is performed using Google Gemini API
- No document content is logged or stored permanently
- Analysis results are user-specific and not shared

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Batch Analysis**: Process multiple documents simultaneously
2. **Comparison Mode**: Compare two documents side-by-side
3. **Template Matching**: Match clauses against standard templates
4. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF reports of analysis results
